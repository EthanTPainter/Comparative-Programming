Folders included provide C, Java, and Python implementations of Data Encryption Standard (DES).
Python is the easiest to implement or understand for developers unfamiliar with encryption/decryption.

Each language includes implementation of specific DES Modes:
	- Electronic Codebook (ECB)
	- Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)
	- Cipher Feedback (CFB)
	- Output Feedback (OFB)

DES is a symmetric-key encryption algorithm.
 
DES is insecure and should not be implemented for any modern applications.
This is only for demonstrational and educational purposes.

For modern cryptography standards, see Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) or alternatives to DES.
